# BeenThere

BeenThere is a travel journaling application utilizing Google Maps API. After creating and logging into an account, a user has access to a full-screen interactive Google Map with autocomplete search capabilities, where they can search for a location they have travelled to. Upon finding a location, a pin will be dropped on that location and a form will appear, allowing the user to log information about their experiences in that place and add pictures to the log. This allows a user to create a visually appealing overview of their worldly travels. When a user has a new travel experience to log, they can simply log back into their account and all their previous pins will be there. 

## Technologies Used

BeenThere is built using TypeScript in an Angular framework on the front end and Java in a Spring Boot framework, connected to a SQL database, on the backend.
